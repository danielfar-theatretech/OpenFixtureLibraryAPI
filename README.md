<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

There are so many DMX fixtures out there; however, I couldn't find any free libraries that really suited my needs, and had all the information I required. So I created this one. I want to create a repository of fixtures so vast and informative that it'll be the last one you ever need!

Here's why:

* Your time should be focused on creating something amazing.
* You shouldn't be wasting time researching and building your own massive library of fixtures

Of course, this repository won't be able to contain every fixture ever! So I'll be adding more and more as much as I can. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people have contributed to expanding this template!

### Built With

This library was built by hand, by real people (so there might be a few mistakes). Feel free to suggest a change or open an issue if you spot any.

The data is in JSON format but the api was built with these tools:

 - express

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

All profiles are separated into their own files, so you can use them as-is if you wish.

Or if you are using the API:

* e.g.
  
```js

```

<!-- _For more examples, please refer to the [Documentation](https://example.com)_ -->
